The response had details about the current administration's nomination of Merick Garland (confirmed by a 73-23 vote).  This answer really threw a wrench in my momentum early on because the answer is not even in the same ballpark as the question. This leaves me with the following uncertainties: (a) Does the AI understand SCOUS? Should I re-phrase. (b) Do I have the name mixed up. (b1) Is Connor not a reference to Sandra Day O'Connor? (b2) Was Sandra Day O'Connor a different politician that I am confusing with Justice Connor? (c) Is it a coincidence that Merrick Garland was also nominated by with a 75-23 outcome? (d) Does it understand the difference between a Republican and a Democrat? (d1) Why would Biden's nomination have a republican majority?  From this, I felt my partner and myself had gotten off to quite a rough start.

adapt my question phrasing to work with this. Also, for a reason I cannot explain, my accuracy in typing appeared to take a nose dive in some of my queries.

My initial assumption would be that a partnered communication exchange should have an 
inherent ability to work with simple spelling errors when the subject is adequately 
unique enough. For example, when I was trying to solve the Hugh Hefner clue, 
I had previous knowledge of the  verbal solution,  but I was unfamiliar with the 
proper spelling of Hefnor. Regardless, any reference to High Hefnor, Hugh Hephnor,  
Hugh Heffnir, Hugh Hephnure would lead a reasonable person to conclude 
there is only one intended reference.

I Found very little success with referencing Hefner himself, but I found success working through my prior knowledge of his relationship with Kendra Wilkinson. But even with this, it 
felt like  the responses mentioned her past boyfriends who were far less known than Mr. Hefner.

I gained some midway confident after solving for the Jemison astronaut. I had gathered she 
was the payload specialist for the Endeavor flight, but her first name seemed absent from all 
responses. I was finally able to achieve success when I stopped using the term ""African American"" in my  queries and rephrased as simply ""black"".","Microsofty, potential, clunky, un-synchronized, "
