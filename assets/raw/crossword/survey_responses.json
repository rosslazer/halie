This answer really threw a wrench in my momentum early on because the answer is not even in the same ballpark as the question. This leaves me with the following uncertainties: (a) Does the AI understand SCOUS? Should I re-phrase. (b) Do I have the name mixed up. (b1) Is Connor not a reference to Sandra Day O'Connor? (b2) Was Sandra Day O'Connor a different politician that I am confusing with Justice Connor? (c) Is it a coincidence that Merrick Garland was also nominated by with a 75-23 outcome? (d) Does it understand the difference between a Republican and a Democrat? (d1) Why would Biden's nomination have a republican majority?  From this, I felt my partner and myself had gotten off to quite a rough start.

But even with this, it \r\nfelt like  the responses mentioned her past boyfriends who were far less known than Mr. Hefner.\r\n\r\nI gained some midway confident after solving for the Jemison astronaut.

In those instances, it gave responses that were unrelated, or not relevant or helpful. Often times I noted that the AI Teammate would repeat what I asked of it, and change some of the terms slightly. It had a tendency to repeat itself, and I found that it did not respond well if I asked my question starting with \u201cWhat\u201d, \u201cWhat is\u201d, or if I mention the clue is about a term with a specific number of letters.",
